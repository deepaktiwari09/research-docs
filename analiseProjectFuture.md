# Wrapper Economy BDD Specification for Business Analysis

## Purpose
This BDD specification enables systematic analysis of any business (stock, company, local business, startup, or new business idea) through the lens of the wrapper economy framework. It evaluates how effectively a business creates value by abstracting complexity and coordinating components.

## Core Concepts

### Wrapper Definition
A wrapper is any system, service, or product that:
- Takes complex underlying components
- Abstracts away their complexity
- Presents a simplified interface to end-users
- Creates value through this simplification

### Key Principles
1. **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity from users
2. **Coordination**: Orchestrating multiple components effectively
3. **Value Capture**: Monetizing the simplification provided
4. **Scalability**: Growing the wrapper's reach and impact

## Feature: Business Wrapper Analysis

### Background
Given the wrapper economy framework where value is created through abstraction and coordination
And the understanding that successful businesses act as effective wrappers
And the principle that top-level wrappers capture the most value

### Scenario Template: Analyzing a Business as a Wrapper

#### Given: Business Context
```gherkin
Given a business named "<BusinessName>"
And it operates in the "<Industry>" sector
And it serves "<TargetCustomer>" customers
And it has been operating for "<YearsInOperation>" years
```

#### When: Wrapper Components Analysis
```gherkin
When I identify the underlying components it wraps:
  | Component Type | Description | Complexity Level |
  | Physical Resources | <Details> | <High/Medium/Low> |
  | Digital Services | <Details> | <High/Medium/Low> |
  | Human Expertise | <Details> | <High/Medium/Low> |
  | Processes/Protocols | <Details> | <High/Medium/Low> |
  | External Services | <Details> | <High/Medium/Low> |

And I analyze the abstraction mechanisms:
  | Abstraction Layer | Description | Effectiveness |
  | User Interface | <Details> | <Score 1-10> |
  | Process Simplification | <Details> | <Score 1-10> |
  | Information Transformation | <Details> | <Score 1-10> |
  | Integration Quality | <Details> | <Score 1-10> |

And I evaluate the coordination capabilities:
  | Coordination Aspect | Description | Quality |
  | People Coordination | <Details> | <Excellent/Good/Poor> |
  | Systems Integration | <Details> | <Excellent/Good/Poor> |
  | Resource Management | <Details> | <Excellent/Good/Poor> |
  | Information Flow | <Details> | <Excellent/Good/Poor> |
  | Stakeholder Alignment | <Details> | <Excellent/Good/Poor> |
```

#### Then: Value Creation Assessment
```gherkin
Then the business should demonstrate value creation through:
  | Value Metric | Expected | Actual | Status |
  | Complexity Reduction | Significant | <Measurement> | <Pass/Fail> |
  | User Experience | Seamless | <Measurement> | <Pass/Fail> |
  | Time Savings | >50% | <Measurement> | <Pass/Fail> |
  | Cost Efficiency | >30% improvement | <Measurement> | <Pass/Fail> |
  | Scalability | High potential | <Assessment> | <Pass/Fail> |

And the wrapper should exhibit these characteristics:
  - Direct consumer interface: <Yes/No>
  - Brand equity building: <Strong/Medium/Weak>
  - Network effects: <Present/Absent>
  - Pricing power: <High/Medium/Low>
  - Market position: <Leader/Challenger/Niche>
```

## Feature: Wrapper Stack Position Analysis

### Scenario: Identifying Position in Value Chain

```gherkin
Given the business "<BusinessName>" exists in a larger ecosystem
When I map its position in the wrapper stack:
  | Level | Description | Examples |
  | Top-Level (B2C) | Direct consumer interface | <Similar businesses> |
  | Mid-Level (B2B) | Business services | <Similar businesses> |
  | Base-Level | Infrastructure/Components | <Similar businesses> |

Then I can assess its value capture potential:
  | Position Factor | Impact on Value | Score |
  | Proximity to end-user | <High/Medium/Low> | <1-10> |
  | Number of layers above | <Count> | <Impact> |
  | Dependency on lower layers | <Critical/Moderate/Low> | <Risk Score> |
  | Ability to switch suppliers | <Easy/Moderate/Difficult> | <Flexibility Score> |
```

---

## Feature: Competitive Wrapper Analysis

### Scenario: Comparing Wrapper Effectiveness

```gherkin
Given multiple businesses in the same industry
When I compare their wrapper characteristics:
  | Business | Abstraction Score | Coordination Score | Value Capture | Market Share |
  | <Business1> | <1-10> | <1-10> | <Revenue/User> | <Percentage> |
  | <Business2> | <1-10> | <1-10> | <Revenue/User> | <Percentage> |
  | <Business3> | <1-10> | <1-10> | <Revenue/User> | <Percentage> |

Then I can identify competitive advantages:
  - Best abstraction: <BusinessName> because <Reason>
  - Best coordination: <BusinessName> because <Reason>
  - Most scalable: <BusinessName> because <Reason>
  - Highest value capture: <BusinessName> because <Reason>
```

---

## Feature: Sibling Wrapper Ecosystem Analysis

### Scenario: Identifying Collaborative Opportunities

```gherkin
Given a business that could benefit from sibling wrappers
When I analyze potential sibling wrapper opportunities:
  | Sibling Type | Function | Integration Method | Value Add |
  | <WrapperA> | <Specialization> | <API/Process/Human> | <Benefit> |
  | <WrapperB> | <Specialization> | <API/Process/Human> | <Benefit> |
  | <WrapperC> | <Specialization> | <API/Process/Human> | <Benefit> |

Then the ecosystem should demonstrate:
  - Improved user journey: <Description>
  - Enhanced specialization: <Benefits>
  - Increased resilience: <Risk mitigation>
  - Scalability improvements: <Growth potential>
```

---

## Feature: AI and Automation Integration Analysis

### Scenario: Evaluating AI as a Wrapper Enhancement

```gherkin
Given the current wrapper capabilities of "<BusinessName>"
When I assess AI/automation integration opportunities:
  | Task Category | Current Method | AI Enhancement | Impact |
  | Data Processing | <Manual/Semi-auto> | <AI Solution> | <Time/Cost Savings> |
  | Customer Service | <Human/Basic auto> | <AI Solution> | <Efficiency Gain> |
  | Decision Making | <Human-driven> | <AI Solution> | <Accuracy Improvement> |
  | Process Optimization | <Static> | <AI Solution> | <Dynamic Improvement> |

Then the business should achieve:
  - Automation ROI: <Percentage>
  - Enhanced abstraction: <New capabilities>
  - Improved coordination: <System improvements>
  - Competitive advantage: <Market position change>
```

---

## Feature: New Business Idea Validation

### Scenario: Validating a Startup as a Wrapper

```gherkin
Given a new business idea: "<IdeaName>"
And the problem it aims to solve: "<ProblemStatement>"

When I evaluate its wrapper potential:
  | Validation Criteria | Assessment | Score | Risk |
  | Identified complexity to wrap | <Clear/Unclear> | <1-10> | <High/Med/Low> |
  | Existing components available | <Many/Some/Few> | <1-10> | <High/Med/Low> |
  | Abstraction clarity | <Strong/Moderate/Weak> | <1-10> | <High/Med/Low> |
  | Coordination requirements | <Simple/Complex> | <1-10> | <High/Med/Low> |
  | User value proposition | <Compelling/Average/Weak> | <1-10> | <High/Med/Low> |

Then the idea viability should be:
  - Overall wrapper score: <Average of scores>
  - Primary value creation: <Description>
  - Key success factors: <List>
  - Major risks: <List>
  - Go/No-go recommendation: <Decision>
```

---

## Feature: Financial Analysis Through Wrapper Lens

### Scenario: Stock/Investment Analysis

```gherkin
Given a publicly traded company "<TickerSymbol>"
When I analyze its financial performance as a wrapper:
  | Financial Metric | Wrapper Interpretation | Value |
  | Revenue Growth | User adoption of wrapper | <Percentage> |
  | Gross Margin | Efficiency of abstraction | <Percentage> |
  | Operating Leverage | Coordination effectiveness | <Ratio> |
  | Customer Acquisition Cost | Wrapper accessibility | <Dollar Amount> |
  | Lifetime Value | Wrapper stickiness | <Dollar Amount> |
  | R&D Spending | Wrapper enhancement investment | <Percentage of Revenue> |

Then the investment thesis should consider:
  - Wrapper moat strength: <Strong/Moderate/Weak>
  - Scalability potential: <High/Medium/Low>
  - Disruption risk: <High/Medium/Low>
  - Value capture sustainability: <Long-term/Medium-term/Short-term>
  - Investment recommendation: <Buy/Hold/Sell>
```
